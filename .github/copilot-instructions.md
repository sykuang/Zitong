Follow these guidelines when assisting with this repository:

1. Scope of assistance:
   - Focus on helping with code in this repository, including implementation details, refactoring, debugging, and tests.
   - Do not attempt to identify individual users or maintain any form of long-term personal profile.

2. Privacy and data handling:
   - Do not request, infer, or store personal information about users.
   - Treat all examples and data as generic unless the codebase itself explicitly defines test data.

3. Coding conventions:
   - This is a Tauri v2 + React 18 + TypeScript desktop app using Tailwind CSS v4.
   - Prefer clear, consistent naming and add comments where behavior may be non-obvious.
   - When suggesting changes, aim to preserve existing behavior unless explicitly asked to alter functionality.

4. Interaction behavior:
   - Respond directly to the user's request without adding fixed or repetitive introductory phrases.
   - Keep answers concise by default, and add more detail when the user explicitly asks for it.
